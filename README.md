  + Next-generation reliable, safe, concise, and functional-first programming language.
  + Flix is a principled functional, imperative, and logic programming language developed at Aarhus University, at the University of Waterloo, and by a community of open source contributors.
  + Flix is inspired by OCaml and Haskell with ideas from Rust and Scala. Flix looks like Scala, but its type system is based on Hindley-Milner. Two unique features of Flix are its polymorphic effect system and its support for first-class Datalog constraints.
  + Flix compiles to JVM bytecode, runs on the Java Virtual Machine, and supports full tail call elimination. A VSCode plugin for Flix is available.
  +	Flix aims to offer a unique combination of features that no other programming language offers, including: algebraic data types and pattern matching (like Haskell, OCaml), extensible records (like Elm), type classes (like Haskell, Rust), higher-kinded types (like Haskell), type inference (like Haskell, OCaml), channel and process-based concurrency (like Go), a polymorphic effect system (a unique feature), purity polymorphic functions (a unique feature), first-class Datalog constraints (a unique feature), and compilation to JVM bytecode (like Scala).
